    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Welcome to my profile</span></h1>
<h2>Personal Information:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">My name is Nguyen Minh Quang and my student ID is s3825058. You can reach me at s3825058@rmit.edu.vn. Or you can just click here to <a href = "mailto: s3825058@rmit.edu.vn">Send Email to Me</a>. I'm from Vietnam and i can speak both Vietnamese and English. I was born on August 12th 2001. Did you know that most students spend more time for leisure activities than studying and so do I :)</p>
<h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">Since I was young, I have always loved playing games. Playing games in the early 2000s is so much more complicated than nowadays. You have to understand how to extract, replace files, troubleshooting when app doesn’t work properly, deal with virus, Bios,… As the result, I already have the basic understanding about IT. As I grow, I fully understand the importance of IT in our life. That is when it sparked my interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">RMIT is a global university recognised for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise. With world class Australian education, excellent facilities, amazing lecturer and industry connection, I believe RMIT is the perfect place to kick off my career.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">I hope to gain more real-world experience. These days, it takes much more than just knowledge from textbook to be success.</p>
<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">The job is about carrying out teaching activities. I always like to work with young people. So being able to work around group of enthusiasm students and experienced staffs seem to be the perfect opportunity to improve my research and professional capacity. The job requires a PhD qualification, teaching experience in Advanced Manufacturing Engineering and Management, research record in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and able to use typical manufacturing machines and tools. My plan is to able to finish Undergraduate program and land a job in the automotive industry. I will continue working for a few years in the industry in order to gain experience. Meanwhile I will continue my research to earn the PhD. And hopefully 1 day, I will able to work with RMIT again.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">My results are:</p>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">Myers-Briggs test: Advocate INFJ-T</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">Learning style test: Auditory/Visual learner</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">Big Five Personality test: Openness 65%, Conscientiousness 79%, Extraversion 29%, Agreeableness 81%, Neuroticism 40%</li>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">To be honest, these results doesn’t mean much to me. I have taken these tests before and they gave different results. To me, I think personal interest, habit and personality can be changed easily. I believe to work well as team member, it is important to keep your head down, keep calm rather than being picky about teammates’ personalities and study habits. My strategy when working in a group is to always listen to others. Simply understand your teammates often solves a lot of problems, conflicts and misunderstandings. Besides, stating your opinion is also crucial. By doing so, you not only contribute in the project but also give everybody a chance to understand you and quite possibly results in a smoother working experience. </p>
<h2>Project Ideas:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">My dream project at the moment is to build a help-to-study app for students especially college and university students. This idea doesn’t seem to be new. As the matter of fact, learning apps have existed for a very long time. However, I want to put my own twist on the app in order to make it more useful to both students and teachers. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">I have been using learning app for a few years now. Most of the apps, although very useful in various of scenarios such as provide key detail, important information, tips/tricks to study and solutions, still have 1 major flaw in common: the connection. “The connection” here is not about Wi-Fi or cellular data, it is about the connection between student and the lecture/lesson. Study face-to-face has always been more appealing than study entirely through a screen. You don’t get the excitement from listening to an amazing lecturer, you miss all the fun talking with your friends in class, you don’t have the explanation, guidance and help from the teachers. So, instead of trying to make an improved self-study app, I want to make an app that hep to improve the quality of the lessons in class. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">The app that I want to build is going to be a mobile device app. By doing this, the app will be very accessible to all the students and teachers. In best case scenario, the app should be pre-installed on every study device in school/university. The application is going to be a multi-function app. First, the app has to have all the lecture file and recorded video of the lecture so that students can revise or study at home in case the student miss the lesson, similar to other study app. Not only the lecture, homework should also be put on this app. For the sake of simpler assessing students’ work, homework should be written in multiple choice format and automatically assess by the app. By doing so, it encourages students to spend their time revise the lesson and practice by doing homework. Besides, this method can save the teachers a lot of time checking students’ work and helping students who not fully understand the lecture. Another problem needs to address is the lack of understanding of an ongoing class session. A lot of students don’t fully understand the lecture for various reason. For instance, the language barrier can prevent students from following the lesson or sometimes the reason can simply be lack of attention. I believe this problem happens due to the so little interaction happen between teacher and student especially when there are 100 students in a class. Students who can’t follow the lecture tend to stay silent instead of asking question because of shyness. To tackle this problem, I want to implement the real time feedback feature into the app. During the lecture, after a section, students have to answer a set of questions relate to that section or give a brief summary of that section. The answers will be checked either by the app or the lecturer and his/her assistant. This will establish a lot of students’ interaction and participation in the lecture and also help teachers identify which student need help, hence improve the lecture quality. Another feature I would love to include in the app is course recommendation. The app will analyze the students’ major, their scores in every course, identify their weakness and strength in order to give suggestion in course selection. Finally, I want the app to report the real time busyness of each location around the campus. This last feature doesn’t directly improve the study quality; however, I believe this will become very handy in many situations. For example, students by using this feature can know how many people inside the library before they come to the library. If the library is too crowded, they can use online library instead or come to the library in another time. This can simply be done by using some small devices like Raspberry Pi to log MAC address of Wi-fi and Bluetooth device nearby similar to the way they do in shopping mall or airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">To build this app, first you need to have some coding program, something like Swift, Xcode or Android Studio, … You also need to design the user interface with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Experience Design, … To store user data, lectures, marks, ... you also need to have a server. And finally, some device to collect data around campus such as Raspberry Pi. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">To be able to build the app, I think I will need to learn a few programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Swift, … Besides, it also will be essential to learn HTML and JavaScript for web designing and server operating. Additionally, I also need to able to use Adobe Photoshop, Experience Design, Illustrator in order to design user interface for the app. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">I would say this project although is a “dream project”, it is actually very practical. If the project is successful, I believe this app will drastically improve learning quality and students’ interest. It will help millions of students. However, it will not be easy. In order for it to work out, the project need a huge support from schools, universities, teachers and students. I still have a long way to go but hopefully one day I will make it. </p>
